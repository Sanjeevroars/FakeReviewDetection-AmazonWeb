The built quility is good and premium, earpads are very soft but bit small in size but it will comfortable in 2 days, connectivity is very good, good for movies and music (not bass), battery life is also very good. At first I didn't like this headphones because it has low sound with compare to my previous earphone but after using this headphone for 2 days I loved it. It has balanced sound not for bass lovers. Vocals are very clear and you can differentiate between vocals and instruments easily. If you love more vocal than bass than go for it.\n",

      "Here's the TLDR: gets uncomfortable after about an hour of use if you have big ears like I do. Sounds pretty good considering the price, slightly on the bassier side, but fairly neutral overall. Best in the price range I think, at least compared to the offerings from JBL. The marshall major 3 wireless has better sound, build quality and comfort but doesn't have the voice assistant support. Skip to the last for the scores.Allow me to explain in detail:THE SOUND:It sounds good. I love Sennheiser's sound signature and this one has been tuned to have a very slight bassier curve. Bassheads won't like it i suppose. Upper bass range sounds a bit muddy to my ears, though only when listened very closely. Most users won't notice it i suspect. The lower highs could use a bit more punch. It does struggle a tad to produce the very high frequencies (12khz+). I'll be honest, i do like my listening headphones to be a bit on the beassier end but I absolutely hate the way Skullcandy, Beats etc achieve that. These, however, have quite an enjoyable sound signature, especially once you tweak your eq. The headphones respond really well to eq tweaks, especially inside the Sennheiser app (the app doesn't offer a parametric eq but it does have a eq thing that lets you move around a dot and tries to adjust the eq accordingly.)The sound stage is okay and the imaging is quite good. Instrument separation is fine for the price.COMFORT AND BUILD:The build quality is good. It's all plastic but the plastic feels solid. No complaints there.However, the headphones are small for overheads. It might be just me though as I'm only really familiar with overhead headphones like the M40x, M50x, some AKGs, Beyerdynamic etc, all of which go well over the ears and are incredibly comfortable (the ATH M series NEED the Brainwavs earpads though) and all of them have a nice and gentle clamping force. Anyways, back to this pair.The earpads are not memory-foam and the sides are unnecessarily wide, thus doesn't leave much room for the ears inside. Since I've big ears, the pads rest somewhat toward the ends of my ears, which makes them uncomfortable for longer sessions. However, the clamping force is not bad and that makes the pair relatively pleasant. I say relatively because the JBL LIVE 500BTs have a clamping force of 0.7kg (vs only about 0.2kg of these. as per testings of rtings.com), which feels like getting crushed under a rock.The earpads are replaceable so I'm hoping that brainwavz will release some really nice and plush pads for these headphones, which should improve the comfort further. These aren't bad the way they are though. If you have smaller ears, i think you'll be perfectly happy.UPDATE: The regular brainwavz pleather pads do fit these just fine. It makes them incredibly comfortable. Although the earpads are a tad oversized but it doesn't come off or wiggle or anything like that. They make the bass response quite weak though. Pick your poison i guess.Tip: turning the earpads about 30° (may vary) clockwise may improve the comfort dramatically.MISCELLANEOUS THINGS:Battery life seems to be excellent. Noise isolation is passive but it does a decent job.VERDICT:I think they're worth the price and better than the competition. They're built well and they sound decent. They don't have some bells and whistles like audio passthrough but it has either better comfort or better sound quality compared to those. The inclusion of a type c port is nice. AptX low latency support is great for Android users. Overall it gets my recommendation.SCORES, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE PRICE:Sound: 6.7/10Build: 7/10Comfort: 5.9/10Battery: 10/10Bluetooth range: 9/10Bells and Whistles: 5/10\n",

      "Sennheiser is reputed brand mainly for the mic and headphone for recording in studio and PA systems. If you need the pure and accurate sound reproduction this HD 350BT is some best, however a wired headphone is  more recommended for studio recordings. This HD 350BT Wireless Bluetooth is not for music entertainment if you desired for heavy bass and trebles. It's noise enhance (not reduction) has superb active when you peak a call over the mobile phone. This is truly a waste of money product and I bought this by mistake on he name of the brand quality reputation. Only one thing is good that it's design and best covering ears. It looks best but works as local. It's not for music enjoy nor for peaking call over the mobile it's just for listening as it as original recordings.\n",

      "I have been using this headphones for a year now, since I have a piercing in my ear, the ear pads starts hurting after few hours of use. Please don't expect much of base. My power button has stopped working and now the headphones always stays on the pairing mode. A good headphone for vocals and instrument seperation until it's working. I do feel the plastic quality on this could have been better and i also feel if possible adding a bit more money to have the noise cancellation version is also a better thought than buying these.\n",

      "Beautiful product. Sound quality is signature Sennheiser. Strong build. Battery life is just too good. Headphones are comfortable on ear,but would not recommend to people with big ears. In terms of microphone,I hear a slight echo of my own voice while talking,which is irritating. Could have done a better job.The base is low, but I am more into instrumental music and these headphones have a crystal clear output in sound. They aren't excessively loud which I liked. Noice cancellation is partial.Overall a good package by Sennheiser. I had to check out some settings tips online on youtube for pairing the headphones with other devices,it wasnt mentioned in the manual. Also about how to unpair with old devices.4.5 stars out of 5.\n",

      "I bought the 350bt for ₹6299. My 3 week experience has been great so far. This is my first purchase in the premium headphone segment.Pros.Great sound qualityBuild quality is top notchBluetooth range is excellentBattery life is AWESOME (40 hours in a single charge)Type c chargingDual device pairingApp supportCall quality has been fantasticPassive noise isolation is greatCons.Earpads are cramped with no breathing room for one's ears.People with larger ears might find the experience to be uncomfortableLack of Active noise cancellation and Ambient modeLack of 3.5mm audio jackOverall the pros definitely outweigh the cons. People who prioritise comfort over everything else should stay away from the 350bt.(Sony's ch710n and Skullcandy Crusher or Hesh ANC will be more comfortable)Highly recommeded for audiophiles who really care about the sound signature, for enthusiasts who love features like dual device pairing, app support, type c port.\n",
